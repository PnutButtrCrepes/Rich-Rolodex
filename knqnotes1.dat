                                        James Madison Quotes                ON WAR AND PRESIDENTIAL POWER“Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”        - James Madison, Letters and other writings of James MadisonEOC
                                        Alexander Hamilton Quotes        ON TRADE AND THE ECONOMY“There are some who maintain that trade will regulate itself, and it is not to be benefited by the encouragements or restraints of government. Such persons will imagine that there is no need of a common directing power. This is one of those wild speculative paradoxes, which have grown into credit among us, contrary to the uniform practice and sense of the most enlightened nations.”EOC

W. Bush:            "It may be that the sense of responsiblilty built into the presidency exerts a tremendous psychological pressure unimaginable to those of us who have not been there.            The possibly fatal flaw of the Constitution pointed out by Mason, Henry, et al is that it makes the President too much the leader ot the nation.            This focuses all eyes on the President in times of crisis and leaves him overwhelmed.             He has to act and the burden of the responsibility is so great it matters little if he acts outside the bounds of the Constitution."     EOC

The answer, I think, would be thesame from a modern man in Hong Kong, from an eighteenth century revolutionary in colonial America,from a prehistoric hunter-gatherer in Europe, or from an early proto-human hunter/forager on the plainsof Africa: Leave me alone to pursue my happiness!EOC
